# Hospital-Financial-dasboard
Rural vs Urban hospitals financial Dashboard
 This project  analyzes financial and operational data to uncover key factors affecting the viability of rural hospitals in the U.S.
It aims to identify the drivers of financial distress among rural healthcare providers and recommend data-informed strategies to support their long-term sustainability.
Built a linear regression model to predict net income based on factors like uncompensated care, bed utilization, and Medicaid reliance.
This dashboard enables policymakers, administrators, and researchers to visually explore risk patterns, prioritize interventions, and improve decision-making in rural healthcare.
 The use of machine learning and data visualization provided deeper insight into operational risk factors and empowered more strategic forecasting.
Iâ€™m inspired by how predictive analytics and visual storytelling can help address real-world challenges in healthcare equity and access.
 Tools Used: Big Query SQL, Python, Tableau
